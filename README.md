# JQuery Server Calculator

## Description

I created a user interface where the user can input two values (2 input elements) and the select type of mathematical operation. When the submit (`=` button) is clicked, the input is captured, bundled up in an object, and sent to the server to evaluate the expression.

The application also includes a historical record of all math operations on the server, which is updated via information from the server.

> NOTE: History should exist even after refreshing the page.

I used Javascript, jQuery, Express, and Node.js to complete this application.
